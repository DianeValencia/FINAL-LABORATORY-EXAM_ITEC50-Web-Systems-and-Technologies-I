ITEC 50 Finals Lab Exam – Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my submission for the **Finals Lab Exam** in **ITEC 50: Web Systems and Technologies I**.

## Description

For the final project, I created a **fully custom personal portfolio website** built entirely from **scratch** — without using frameworks like Bootstrap. The goal was to demonstrate mastery in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** by developing all components manually, including layout, styling, responsiveness, and interactivity.

## Features

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean, modern UI design
- Custom CSS styling (no Bootstrap, personal challenge)
- Multiple sections: Quizzes, Activities, Examinations
- Image and media integration
- Interactive elements using JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Objective

- Build a portfolio that reflects both design and development skills
- Practice semantic coding and accessibility
- Avoid pre-built libraries and write everything manually (personal challenge)
