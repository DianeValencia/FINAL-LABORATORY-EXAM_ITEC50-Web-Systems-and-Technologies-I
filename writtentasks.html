              <dt>My Growht from first activity to last:</dt>
                <dd>Throughout Activities 1 to 4, I experienced firsthand how rewarding and challenging the journey into web development can be.</dd>
                <dd>In Activity 1, I started with the basics—writing pure HTML to build a simple web page. It was my first exposure to structuring content on the web, using elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. This activity gave me a solid foundation and a clearer understanding of how websites begin.</dd>
                <dd>Moving to Activity 2, I expanded that foundation by making my page more interactive. I learned how to embed images, audio, and video, create lists, and add a navigation bar. It was exciting to see how much more engaging a site becomes with multimedia. Recreating the layout based on reference images helped me develop an eye for design and page structure.</dd>
                <dd>Activity 3 introduced a whole new layer—CSS. For the first time, I was able to visually style a page, applying colors, spacing, alignment, and typography. What made it even more challenging was that we were given only a picture of a finished website and had to recreate it from scratch, writing both the HTML and CSS ourselves. This tested my attention to detail and deepened my understanding of how code turns into design.</dd>
                <dd>Finally, in Activity 4, I brought everything together—HTML, CSS, and now JavaScript. I built a fully functional tribute website, complete with multiple pages and interactivity. I wrote my own content, styled the layout, and added dynamic features. It felt like the culmination of everything I had learned so far, and seeing the final result gave me a strong sense of accomplishment.</dd>
                <dd>Each activity built upon the last, and through them, I grew more confident not just in writing code—but in solving problems, thinking creatively, and expressing ideas through digital design.</dd>
